## Overview

Donora is a **mobile-based blood donation information system** designed to facilitate **real-time monitoring of blood stock availability**, emergency blood requests, and donor reminders. This system aims to bridge the gap between blood banks, hospitals, and potential donors by ensuring efficient communication and accessibility.

The platform consists of:

- A **landing page** developed with **React.js** to provide information and engage users.
- A **backend system** built with **Laravel**, handling data processing, user authentication, and API integrations.
- A **mobile app** that connects donors with blood banks, sends reminders for donation schedules, and allows users to request blood in emergencies.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Used for building an interactive and responsive landing page.
- **Laravel** – Backend framework handling authentication, data management, and API endpoints.
- **REST API** – Enables communication between the frontend, backend, and mobile application.
- **Firebase** – Implemented for real-time notifications and authentication.
- **MySQL** – Database for storing user data, blood stock records, and transaction history.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Used for styling the landing page with a modern and clean UI.

## Challenges and Learnings
