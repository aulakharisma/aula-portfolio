## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: For backend development.
- **Vite**: For efficient frontend development and faster build times.
- **MySQL**: For managing relational databases and ensuring data integrity.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern UI design.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **CPanel**: For Deployment and Server Management.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Blackbox Testing**: For ensuring the system meets business requirements before deployment
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: For validating system functionality from a user perspective.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges I encountered was working within the Pengawasan Investasi Rutin Departmen, where none of the team members had an IT backgroundâ€”all were technical experts serving as project supervisors. This made it difficult to translate complex business processes into system features. However, after several brainstorming sessions with AVP and project control teams, we were able to identify and agree on the key functionalities.

I learned a great deal about effective communication during this process, especially how to simplify technical IT terminology when discussing ideas with non-technical stakeholders such as AVP and project control team.

## Outcome

The System is now actively used by Pengawasan Investasi Rutin EPC department at PT Petrokimia Gresik and contractors, successfully streamlining business processes. Additionally, the system was showcased at the Innovation Convention of the Development Department and was recognized at the Petrokimia Gresik Innovation Convention.
